# CIntegerAdder
### This Program takes 2 Integers Inputted by the user
### And outputs the Sum

#### Workflow:

I decided to challenge myself here, by taking on multiple new technologies in making this repo.


##### IDE Change

Previously I was using VSC, but for this project I grabbed NeoVim by the balls.

##### Makefile

I also learned how to use makefiles, which of course is more useful in large projects that need certain files to be compiled in a certain order, but I wanted to play around with it anyway.
